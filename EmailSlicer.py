# Email slicer
# Collect an email address from the user and then find out if the user has a custom domain name or a popular domain name. For example:

# Input: mary.jane@gmail.com
# Output: Hey Mary, I see your email is registered with Google. That's cool!.
# Input: peter.pan@myfantasy.com
# Output: Hey Peter, looks like you've got your own custom setup at MyFantasy. Impressive!.
# This is a convenient python project that has a lot of use in the future. The program helps get you the username and domain name from an email address.

# If you want to push this further, you can customize the application and send a message to the host with this information.
